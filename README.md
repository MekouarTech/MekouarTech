Hi, I’m @MekouarTech 👋

    👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development, .NET Core, Blazor, and Clean Architecture.
    🌱 I’m currently learning new testing frameworks like Playwright and NUnit, as well as improving my knowledge in CI/CD pipelines.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source .NET projects, especially in areas of web APIs, cloud-based solutions, and UI/UX with Blazor.
    📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at [your-email@example.com] or on Twitter @MekouarTech.
    😄 Pronouns: He/Him
    ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a Blazor web app in under an hour just to test a new framework, and it worked perfectly!
